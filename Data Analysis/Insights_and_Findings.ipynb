Property crime (green line) consistently dominates the volume, showing an upward trend during warmer months (peaking around July-August). Violent crime (orange line) remains relatively stable but lower in volume."

    "## 4. Actionable Insights & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, we propose the following data-driven strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Targeted Resource Allocation (Cluster-Based):**\n",
    "    * **Cluster 1 (Orange Districts):** Deploy specialized violence intervention units and de-escalation teams.\n",
    "    * **Cluster 2 (Green Districts):** Increase visible foot and bike patrols to deter theft and property damage, especially during business hours and early evenings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Shift Realignment:**\n",
    "    * Resources should be maximized during the **12:00 PM – 11:00 PM** window.\n",
    "    * Friday and Saturday nights require specific \"surge\" capacity for crowd control and alcohol-related offenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Arrest Rate Investigation:**\n",
    "    * Conduct a deep-dive audit into the \"outlier\" districts that have high crime volume but low arrest rates (<10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Limitations & Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reporting Bias:** The analysis relies solely on reported incidents.\n",
    "* **Geospatial Filtering:** We assumed that coordinates falling outside the Chicago bounding box were errors and excluded them.\n",
    "* **Weekend Definition:** We defined \"Weekend\" strictly as Saturday and Sunday."
